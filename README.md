### Deliverables

1. Does the schema need to change?
(hint: yes!)
2. what additional routes are needed?


As a site visitor, I should be able to see a list of authors. I should be able to click on each author's name to see more information about the author.

This author show page should include a list of book's the author has written. As a site vistor, I should be able to click on each book title to see more information about that book

----------------------------------

As a site visitor, I should be able to see a form where I create a book. When I create a book I can associate it with an existing author.


### Stretch Goal
As a site visitor, I should be able to see a form where I create a book. When I create a book I can associate it with an existing author _OR associate the book with a new author who's name I enter_.




fill_in :name {with: 'blahblah'}
<label for='name'>Name</label>
<input type='text' id='name' name='name'>
